- Multi Target Tracking using AWR1642 TI FMCW radar chip with 2 TX and 4 RX operating at 77 GHz. 
- The signal processing block includes:   Range estimation --> CFAR --> Doppler estimation --> CFAR --> Doppler compensation --> Angle of arrival estimation 
- Tracking: Kalman Filter - Constant Velocity motion model
- Data Association is based on Joint Probabilistic Data Association filter (JPDAF)

- Three stationary cars are identified with labels ranging from 0 to 2 and a person is walking in front of the radar.
- The project has been coded in C and Python3.
